# Horiseon Refractor Project

## Horiseon HTML, CSS and GIT Code Refractor Module 1


### Description

    -The focus of this project is to make this webpage more accessible and to meet 
    Web accessability requirements to provide for people with disabilities and to improve search engine optimization. 

    My intent was to remove the duplicate CSS code, broken links, and overall incomplete semantic HTML application. By consolidating CSS  and HTML selectors and properties to reduce clutter and ensure for greater readability and long term sustainability.
	 

## What We Learned

    -Improve accessibility using best semantic practices by properly using html elements by replacing <div> elements with correct better elements. 
    -Better organize CSS by consolidating selectors and replacing redundant code that inhibits performance and the user experience.
	 -Removing the fonts Lucida Grande, Gill Sans, Gill Sans MT that have a low installation percentage on Windows OS.
    -Strategically uses classes selectors, element id's and many other selectors to make improve the semantic structure.
